## 📖 Project Description

This project is a **multi-page web application** designed to simulate a basic user management system with an integrated to-do list. It includes:

- A **Registration page** where users can sign up with name, email, and password.
- A **Login page** that checks user credentials stored in local storage.
- A **Home page** with a personalized to-do list interface that allows users to add, complete, or delete tasks.

All user data and tasks are handled using the browser's `localStorage`, which means data persists even after page refreshes. This project is fully frontend-based with no backend, making it ideal for practicing DOM manipulation, data persistence, and user input validation in JavaScript.
